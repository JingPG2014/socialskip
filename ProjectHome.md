SocialSkip Service is freely available online for those who do not want to install the system by themselves: http://www.socialskip.org/

The main feature of SocialSkip is a video browser with custom player buttons that collect user interactions with the video to a data-base.

The SocialSkip system operates on Google App Engine and provides integration of YouTube videos and Drive documents.

SocialSkip can be employed in real or experimental scenarios to generate user activity graphs of an online video, by analyzing usersâ€™ interactions with the system, such as play, pause, skip/scrub.The SocialSkip system employs a custom web-video player and a web-database to keep a record of basic user actions (play, pause, and skip).

SocialSkip is also integrated with Google Drive, which allows the addition of a questionnaire next to the video. This feature has been useful in video experiments for learning, which include quiz questions next to the video.
